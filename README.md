# LiftoffPractice

This is my capstone project that I worked on after going through LaunchCode's CodeCamp program.
I came up with the idea for this application because I am a musician and music teacher and it has always been difficult for me to track what materials and songs I havd worked on and which materials and songs that I would like to work on in the future.
The ultimate goal of this project would be to provide myself and other musicians with a helpful resource to organize what songs, exercises, and ideas they have in their repitore.
A user should be able to create an account or log in to create new objects which represent their practice materials and access and update all of the materials that they have previously added.
When creating a new material instance, the user is required to add the name of the practice material and they have options to add a description, key, tempo, time signature, and artist or composer to the object.
When viewing the homepage, the user can click on the name of any practice material that they have previously created to see more details and make updates to their progress.
The user can also search by name from the homescreen.

I would love to add functionality to allow the user to add other resources to each material and have more meaningful ways to track their pregress.

Some ideas that I had are:
-An integrated metronome
-Integrated tuner
-A timer to automatically add up practice time
-Ability to upload PDF's
-Tags and more robust search options
-Spotify and/or youtube integration for reference tracks and teaching videos
-Ability to share materials with other users
-An easy way to export material files.

There are more features that I would like to add but those are some of the first that come to mind.

I have really enjoyed working on this project and I think it is something that would be useful for me and for other musicians!
